# Asynconf_GreenBank
My submission to the Asynconf Hackathon's 'GreenBank' subject. Subject is at https://asynconf.fr/docs/sujet_tournoi.pdf
This project is made in Python and uses modules that are not pre-installed by default on interpreters.
Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install all the required modules to your interpreter.
To start the program, run the 'main.py' file.
